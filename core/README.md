# Kul core `no_std` crate

This is the `no_std` crate that provides the core of a parser for:

A unique textual notation that can be used as both a data format and a markup
language and that has powerful extensibility of both syntax and semantics, and a
Rust library for parsing it.  It is inspired by the little-known [Curl
language].
